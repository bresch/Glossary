# Glossary
The latest compiled version of this glossary can be viewed [here](https://github.com/bresch/Glossary/blob/master/main.pdf)

This glossary contains three main parts:
- A list of acronyms: Defines the meaning of several acronyms used in PX4 and in most aeronautics and robotics texts
- A list of symbols: Reserved alphabet letters and decorators widely used in aeronautics and robotics, carefully chosen to avoid any ambiguity
- A definition of notation: General rules to define a vector, scalar, meaning of super- and subscripts, etc. (**TODO**)

Notations are mostly taken from:
